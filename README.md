Write-ups:

The black hat visualization was deliberately designed to mislead viewers by minimizing the perceived severity of a major environmental issue. The data clearly shows a substantial increase in pollutants entering the atmosphere between 1985 and 1990, with little subsequent decline. A truthful representation would highlight this increase, reinforcing the urgency of the problem. However, the manipulative visualization distorts perception using several techniques. The primary distortion tactic used is extending the y-axis bounds to extreme levels. Instead of setting the axis to a range that makes variations in pollution levels visible, the upper bound is pushed far beyond the actual maximum pollutant value. This causes all data points to cluster near the x-axis, making what should be a sharp upward trend appear as a nearly flat line. By doing so, the visualization gives the false impression that pollution levels have remained constant or negligible, deceiving viewers into thinking there is no urgent environmental concern.
