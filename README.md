The black hat visulation was crafted to misrepresent a huge change as a tiny change. The data shows that there was a huge increase in the amount of pollutants entering the atmosphere between the years 1985 and 1990 which didn't go down latter. This would imply that pollutants are a serious problem. The black hat visulation messes with the y-axis by raising the bounds to extreme levels. This makes the graph look like a straight line at y=0 which gives the impression that there is no pollution when there actually is.
